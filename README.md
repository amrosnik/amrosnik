I'm a Data Scientist at [Marine Biologics](https://www.marinebiologics.com/) currently working on developing predictive models to make food and beverage ingredient discovery and development more standardized and driven by a variety of data sources. 

I have a background in computational and theoretical physical chemistry, particularly in statistical mechanics and biophysics. I've worked in the biopharma space for a few years at the intersection of cheminformatics and machine learning, with emphasis on pose/binding mode prediction, (equivariant) graph neural networks, and model explainability. My scientific publications are available on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qrFDlk4AAAAJ&hl=en). 

## Experience 

* Marine Biologics, Director of AI/ML 
* Independent, Data Science Consultant 
* Numerion Labs (fka Atomwise), Cheminformatics Scientist II 
* Enel X, Lead Software Engineer in Distributed Energy Resources  

## Education

* University of California-Berkeley, Ph.D. in Chemistry (emphasis: Physical)
* Hope College, B.S. in Chemistry and Mathematics

## Learning 🌱

In the very near future I hope to dive into 

* Streamlit applications
* Productionizing ML models from scratch
* Forecasting

I welcome any suggestions for where to get started on any of these topics, be they tutorials, open-source projects, or something else!
